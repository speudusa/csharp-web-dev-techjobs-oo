# csharp-web-dev-techjobs-oo
Building upon my Tech Jobs collection.  This version utilizes Object Oriented design as well as unit testing and Test Driven Development (TDD)

The following are the objectives for this assignment:
  + read and understand code written by others
  + work with objects to encapsulate data and methods
  + use the generator in Visual Studio to automate routine tasks
  + use unit testing and TDD to verify and create new methods
  + use inheritence to streamline classes and keep code DRY.
